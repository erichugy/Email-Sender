<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Happy New Year Everyone!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I hope you had a great start to the new year! As part of my new year's resolutions, I'll be sending out&nbsp;</span><strong>monthly "Check-In" emails</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;to keep in touch with my contacts and share my academic journey. This idea came from one of my mentors and friends, Ciara Burrows, who suggested it as a way for me to maintain connections with people while also building a small community of my own. As an introvert, networking can be demanding on the social battery, so this solution seemed like the perfect fit. I'm always open to hearing recommendations on how to improve my emails, as I'm a strong believer in continuous growth.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I recently completed an internship with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada in their Life Cycle Value (LCV) team, and it was an incredible experience. I got the opportunity to explore my interests in programming and develop my own ways of supporting the business. Indeed, despite being a finance major, I mainly worked on projects like creating a data parsing program. This experience helped confirm my passion for programming and the desire to improve businesses through software engineering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I'm now back at McGill for my second year, taking more computer science classes and getting involved in several business technology clubs. I'm also applying for summer 2023 internships in business technology/technology. If you learn of any openings or leads, I'd greatly appreciate hearing from you.</span></p>
